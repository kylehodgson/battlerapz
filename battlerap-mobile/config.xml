        Battle rap scorer is a smartphone app which allows fans to score a battle rap while keeping their eyes on the action. Battles should be debatable because the performers delivered their best performances and not because an online fan canâ€™t score a battle. The B.A.R.S. app offers an easy to use line by line scoring system as well as overall performance scores. Clearly show how battles were won and were points were scored.
